# Challenge-DemocraciaEnRed
Small project - "Democracia en Red" hiring process
For this Project Iâ€™m going to use Materialize (http://materializecss.com) which is a CSS framework that includes the principles of successful design based on Material Design (Google). This should help with the stylesheet coding and with the JS components such as dropdowns and menus.<br/>
The HTML structure will be split into two blocks: Nav and Main. The first one will have a hamburger menu and the title. The other one will contain the form.</br>
For the information that is supposed to be selected in the form, I will use the JSON file along with Jquery to attach the select options.<br/>
For the mobile and web versions, I will use the SideNav that is provided by Materialize.
